'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe

'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws the bite, the claws the catch!
MASTER ADDITION
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!

MASTER ADDITION

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought -
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

SDK2 addition

And as in uffish though he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tuley SDK2
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
MASTER ADDITION
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

SDK 2 addition

'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Calloh callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy aware the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
